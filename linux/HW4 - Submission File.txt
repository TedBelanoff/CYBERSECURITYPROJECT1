2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.
sudo adduser sam
sudo adduser joe
sudo adduser amy
sudo adduser sara
sudo adduser admin

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file:
	sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    - Updates to configuration file:
	minlen = 16
	dcredit=1
	ocredit=1

3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): 

	sudo chage -M 90 sam
	sudo chage -M 90 joe
	sudo chage -M 90 amy
	sudo chage -M 90 sara
	sudo chage -M 90 admin

4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:

	sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: 

	sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):

	for i in sam joe amy sara; do sudo usermod -aG engineers $i; done

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder:

	sudo mkdir engineers 

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:

	sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers

5. Add the SGID bit and the sticky bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory. 

    - Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder:

	sudo chmod u+s /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:
		
	sudo apt install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:

	sudo lynis --help

3. Command to run an audit:

	sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output:


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:

	sudo apt install chkrootkit -y

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:

	sudo chkrootkit -h
	sudo chkrootkit -V
	sudo chkrootkit -l

3. Command to run expert mode:

	sudo chkrootkit -x

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
    - Screenshot of end of sample output:
